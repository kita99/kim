# Kim

Kim is a rudimentary Vim clone, it was bootstrapped from a step by step [tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) which is a
slight modification of [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108).

## Why?

For science! Nope, actually it's because I suck tremendously at C and I'm actively trying to get better at it Ã  la
programmer style... by starting yet another side project which will probably stay unfinished for all of eternity
